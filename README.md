# Adam-Blampied-Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

This is a reformat of my original portfolio (link:  https://ablam87.github.io/Adam-Blampied-Developer-Portfolio/) made largely via Bootstrap 5. It contains links to all my previous applications, as well as contact information, a picture of my handsome face, a small list of the development skills I've currently attained, and a few uninteresting facts about me as a person.

## Link To Application

https://ablam87.github.io/Adam-Blampied-Bootstrap-Portfolio/

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The link is fully responsive for all devices, with a collapsible navbar on small and medium viewports, see images below:

![Large view](./assets/images/Capture%201.PNG)


All general rules are listed at the top of the CSS, as pictured. Rules for specific elements are grouped beneath, as per page layout.

Despite the nature of the challenge being to reducde media queries, there are a small number in the CSS file, purely to remove some optional decoration on mobile, and make things look a little nicer. 

The actual framework of the site is responsive via Bootstrap, as per the challenge.
